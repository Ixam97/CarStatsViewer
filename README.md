## [Changes](/CHANGES.md)


## Installing the app on a car

Currently the app is not available in the public Play Store. This is due to strict requirements by Google what kind of apps are allowed to be installed on cars. As of now the App is only available via internal test tracks which are limited to 100 users each. Currently there are no free internal test slots in any of the existing forks.

There are currently ongoing talks with Polestar to bring the app to a broader audience. But this will take some time and Polestar will most likely require some changes to make the app comply with their safety and usability standards.

## Using the webhook API

The app comes with the possibility to send data to a REST API endpoint. Details on this can be found in the [API documentation](/docs/APIDOC.md).

## Support the development of the app

### Rules for contributing code
<details>

<summary>Please read before contributing and creating Pull Requests!</summary>


- If you want to contribute code you are very welcome to. When creating a Pull Request, make sure to use [active_development](https://github.com/Ixam97/CarStatsViewer/tree/active_development). With the exception of hotfixes I will not merge any PRs into master since that branch is used by other forks to build the app bundle for the Play Store.
- Also describe what you want to archive with your code contribution. Uncommented PRs with no context on what they do are hard to understand and review. To make it easier for me to review and test your contribution make sure to [allow edits from maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

Please also be aware that I will not just include everything. It has to fit into my goals I want to archive with this app. I may just say "I don't feel it" (yes, I know, this joke is getting old üòÖ). It would be best to open an issue beforehand, describing what you want to see in the app and offer your help before starting to code. This way it is possible to exchange ideas before spending hours in coding.
